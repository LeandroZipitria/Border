# Variety and LOP

R files for the paper on Varieties and convergence to the Law of One Price.

This repository provides all files to create the database on price differences, create the dummies on variety and competition, run descriptive statistics, and all regressions. Files are created for the R program.

The first three files create the databases (in levels and differences) and are needed for the analysis.

0-A-create-databases-2020.R: merge price database with product and store information.\
0-B-difference-database-2020.R: create price difference database. \
0-C-instrument-2020.R: calculate the instrument for the price level database. \
0-D-add-instrument-pdiff-database.R: add the instrument for the price difference database. \
